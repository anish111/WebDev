        This website is developed for Web Development course under the guidance of Prof. Richard Rasala and Prof. Annunziato Jose.
         I would like to thank Prof. Rasala and Prof. Jose for their guidance and suggestions during development of the project.
         Since playing and watching tennis is my hobby I decided to take this as my project topic.
