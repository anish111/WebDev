    As I have developed all with testing on google chrome, both my homepage as well as project works
    well on chrome. I have also made all my webpages responsive so that they can be properly viewed in
    small screen devices like tablets and mobiles. 
    <br />
    <br />
    I have also tested my website on Mozilla. While my project works quite well on it but my homepage
    orientation gets disfigured on it.
    Thus I would say my all of my works is best viewed in Chrome browser at resolution 1400 by 700 px or lower.
