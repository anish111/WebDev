    This course has given me a good learning experience of various web technologies.During the course I have worked on 
    Technologies like
    <ul>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS3</li>
        <li>ASP.NET</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>JQuery</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Json</li>
        <li>XML</li>
    </ul>
    After completing various experiements and the final project I can easily say that I have got good hold of these technologies now. 
    I intend to work more and improve my skills in these.

    To develop the project I have used 3 different API's.They are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>ESPN API: I have used this API to get the latest news about tennis and also player specific news.</li>
        <li>Youtube API: I have used this API to get the latest videos related to four major tennis tournaments.</li>
        <li>Google Maps API: I have used this to display the location on the contact us page.</li>
        </ul>
