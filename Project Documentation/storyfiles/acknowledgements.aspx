 I would like to thank Professor Richard Rasala for teaching this course in a very unique and organized manner.
 The coursework gave everyone the freedom to perform our own experiments and learn the new technologies the way we like.
     Professor's various experiments very helpful and helped to kickstart the learning in this course.
    I liked the idea of taking live coding examples in the class.

    I would also like to thank Prof. Jose Annunziato for teaching concepts of API and Json parsing. His website taught me a lot of in depth web development 
 concepts and was one of my major source of reference during the entire course of my learning.<br />
    <br />
&nbsp;I would also like to thank the TA's Anju Sreevalsan and Ketki Gandhe for their help.&nbsp;
